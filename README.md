# tld_snake
The millionth snake clone in existence.

The result of knowledge learned from tile movement. I also split the code up in seperate .pys to make it more clean. To be honest I don't like doing something like that. There's a charm in making a game out of a single file/script. Besides I did trying to make it work was a pain, ever heard of circular imports anyone?

Anyways this is just a very jankly version of snake. Sure, the movement, eating apples and the losing conditions work fine, but you'll still see problems with what happens when the snake eats an apple. Nethertheless, I made it and I'm proud of it. It still functions as a snake game. You're free to use this as a reference or base, although this may be better options out there ngl.

To run this, all you gotta do is keep the 3 python scripts in the same folder and run main.py or you can clone the repository. There's also an standalone exe file you can download that contains the code of all 3 python scripts, so you can just run the .exe and the game should work fine.

Is this anything I could've done better?
